## Description of project

This application allows a user to search for weather anywhere in the world. A current weather forecast is displayed in the main card while a 5 day forecast is also provided underneath. Every time a user searches a unique city, a button is added under the search bar that will allow them to display the data for that city again by simply clicking that button.
